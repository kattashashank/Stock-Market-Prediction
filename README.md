# Stock-Market-Prediction
As part of my first-semester endeavors, I spearheaded a comprehensive study delving into advanced techniques for stock price trend prediction. The focal point of the project was the development and evaluation of a hybrid model, seamlessly integrating a probabilistic technique with the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) approach.
Key Highlights:

ðŸ“Š Challenge Addressed: Tackling the limitations posed by assumptions in distance functions crucial to KNN classification, particularly concerning the exclusion of non-centric data items that could bear statistical significance in predicting stock price trends.

ðŸ”„ Innovative Approach: I proposed a hybrid model that harmoniously incorporates KNN with a probabilistic technique, leveraging the Bayes theorem. This approach calculates the probability of desired occurrences by considering both centric and non-centric data elements.

ðŸ§ª Benchmarking and Evaluation: Traditional classifiers including One Rule, Zero Rule, Naive Bayes, and KNN were systematically assessed alongside the newly devised hybrid KNN probabilistic model. Test results unequivocally demonstrated the superior performance of the suggested model compared to the benchmark classifiers.

Outcome:
The successful execution of this project not only showcased my adeptness in handling intricate challenges in data science but also underscored the efficacy of the hybrid model in enhancing predictive accuracy in stock price trend analysis.

Technologies Utilized:

ðŸ¤– K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
ðŸ“ˆ Probabilistic Techniques
ðŸ“Š Data Analysis and Evaluation (One Rule, Zero Rule, Naive Bayes)
ðŸ§  Machine Learning Algorithms
This project not only honed my technical skills but also instilled a deeper appreciation for the nuanced interplay between probability modeling and machine learning applications. Looking forward to applying these insights in future data-driven endeavors!
